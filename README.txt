Milestone 2--------------------------------------------------------
We used VSCode Live Share to work on almost all functions together.

Katherine:
- handling invalid parameters
- set_append helper function
- evict_block helper function
- load count, load hits, load misses
- store count, store hits, store misses
- total cycles

Angela:
- set_append helper function
- evict_block helper function
- load count, load hits, load misses
- total cycles

Milestone 3--------------------------------------------------------
We ran a variety of experiments to determine which cache configuration had the best overall effectiveness.
There were a few factors that ended up changing the overall performance (looking at the total cycles and misses),
which included cache and block sizes, associativity levels, as well as using either LRU/FIFO and write-through vs.
write-back, write-allocate vs no-write-allocate.

For cache size, the larger the cache, the less total cycles there were, but more misses.

1. Small Cache: ./csim 64 4 16 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 310136
Load misses: 8061
Store hits: 186911
Store misses: 10575

The larger the cache got (at first), the less the total cycles, although it eventually plateaued off.
Sequential increases to cache size donâ€™t result in much of an impact, so we should choose the smaller
one since smaller caches result in a faster access.

For block size, the higher that went, the higher the total cycles went, but the lower the store misses
went, and by a lot.

1. Small Cache: ./csim 4096 4 4 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 313117

Store misses: 27524
Total cycles: 4297403

2. Medium Cache: ./csim 4096 4 16 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 315811
Load misses: 2386
Store hits: 188606

Load misses: 1001

Obviously, we don't want too many cycles or too many misses, so we can find a good sort of middle ground.
Good Middle Ground:  ./csim 4096 4 32 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 316685
Load misses: 1512
Store hits: 192951
Store misses: 4535
Total cycles: 5364571

For associativity levels, the higher the set associative, the lower the total cycles AND the misses... or so it appears.
It seemed like that for the first two tests of increasing the set associative, but there was a plateau after that,
and the resulting statistics remained largely the same.

1. Direct-Mapped: ./csim 4096 1 32 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197

Load misses: 2259
Store hits: 192838
Store misses: 4648
Total cycles: 7584624

2. 4-Way Set Associative: ./csim 4096 4 32 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace

Trying a same set of inputs, but changing the type of eviction from LRU to FIFO did not make a difference, either.

1. FIFO: ./csim 4096 64 32 write-allocate write-back fifo < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 316694
Load misses: 1503
Store hits: 192955
Store misses: 4531
Total cycles: 5341380
2. LRU : ./csim 4096 64 32 write-allocate write-back lru < gcc.trace
Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 316694
Load misses: 1503
Store hits: 192955
Store misses: 4531
Total cycles: 5341380

Write-through produced a LOT of total cycles and a lot of misses compared to write-back, although trying write-allocate
with write-through produced less misses than write-allocate.

1.
